Python Homework Week 3 - PyPoll &amp; PyBank

**Overview**

This folder contains 2 projects.

1. PyBank contains a python file that will run a script to analyze my Company's financial records. 
* We are looking to analyze the following metrics: 
  * Total months in any given data set
  * net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period of the data set
  * more unordered list items here....
* The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results

2. I was tasked with helping a town modernize their vote counting process by creating a script to:
  * calculate the total number of votes cast
  * return a list of candidates who received votes, with percentages/vote counts of wins and losses
