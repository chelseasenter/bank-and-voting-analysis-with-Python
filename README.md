Python Homework Week 3 - PyPoll &amp; PyBank

## Overview of Project Objectives

This folder contains 2 projects. Below is a summary of each project. Enjoy!

### PyBank 
This project contains a __python__ file that will run a script to analyze my Company's financial records from a **csv** file. 

1. The script will analyze the data and calculate the following metrics: 
  * Total number of months in the provided data set
  * Net Profits and Losses over the entire period
  * Changes in Profits and Losses over the entire period
   * as well as the average of those changes
  * Greatest increase and decrease in profits and losses over the entire period, represented by date and amount
  
2. The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results

### PyPoll
In this project, I was tasked with helping a town modernize their vote counting process by creating a python script to process their votes.

1. First, the script calculates the following from the dataset:
  * total number of votes cast
  * a list of candidates who received votes
  * percentage of votes each candidate won
  * total number of votes each candidate won
  * the winner of the election

2. The script will then print out the calculations in the previous step to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# Brainstorming and Pseudocode
-- in this section I will show (1) my initial brainstorming and (2) my pseudocode, so you can follow my thoughts in how I decided to complete these projects. Please forgive me, this section might be a little messy.
